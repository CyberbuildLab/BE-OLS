It represents construction agents (human workers, robots, and other autonomous hardware) as they operate on a site: the processes they carry out, the elements they modify, the resources they handle, and the operational modes and metrics used to assess their performance and impact. To express how agent activities evolve over time, AiC introduces meta-properties that specify when a statement holds (at an instant or over an interval), what dimension of information it represents (planned, simulated, or performed), and who generated it. The ontology emphasizes generic, trade-agnostic concepts to ensure broad applicability across project types and delivery methods.",

    "Description": "The Digital Twin Construction Ontology enables representing the most important concepts that are relevant for a digital twin of a construction site. It explicitly defines the project intent and project status. While the project intent describes the project aim in the form of, e.g., the construction schedule and a 3D building design, the project status describes the situation on the construction site as it was actually observed. In this way, project intent and status can be directly compared to identify any deviations between the two. The project intent is further differentiated into as-planned when referring to processes and as-designed when referring to processes and their required resources. Their counterparts of the project status are as-performed and as-built. The ontology is centred around the construction processes (dtc:Process). These are defined on three levels of detail. The processes have various types of construction resources (dtc:Resource) that are required for their execution, dedicated areas where they are performed (dtc:WorkingZone), preconditions that restrict their starting time (dtc:Precondition), and building elements (bot:Element) that result from their completion. The ontology is designed to form the starting point for representing digital twins of the construction phase. It is by no means an exhaustive list of all concepts related to Digital Twin Construction. The concepts defined here represent core concepts, which should be extended with domain-specific ontologies to cover specific digital twin use cases related to the construction phase.",

One of the primary goals of this system could be to check if a building design, represented in the form of BIM, is compliant with energy performance-related FM design criteria. Accordingly, with the help of the FM Domain Ontology, an integrated and accelerated building design process can be established, where Design Experts can proactively ensure the optimal energy consumption of newly renovated facilities. The ontology contains the Paragraph 405.9.1.1, Paragraph 405.9.1.2, and Paragraph 405.9.1.3 of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2021  in the form of natural text, as well as in the form of SWRL rules.",

This ontology is complementary to the Historic Masonry Ontology (HMO), of which represents an extension. The recommended prefix for this ontology is FMO, and its proposed namespace is https://w3id.org/fmo#. By utilizing the FMO ontology, it becomes possible to determine whether the structure is more susceptible to out-of-plane collapse or if in-plane failures are more likely. The scope is to facilitate the definition of the modeling assmptions, while employing global models for the structural analysis of unreinforced masonry constructions.",

    "Description": "The File Ontology for Geometry formats (FOG) provides geometry schema specific relations between things (e.g. building objects) and their geometry descriptions. These geometry descriptions can be (1) RDF-based (e.g. using specific ontologies such as GEOM, OntoBREP, etc.), (2) RDF literals containing embedded geometry of existing geometry formats and (3) RDF literals containing a reference to an external geometry file. The FOG ontology extends the Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) and consists of three taxonomies of properties. The first two are related to standalone geometry descriptions, i.e. one for RDF-based geometry schemas with as root object property the omg:hasComplexGeometryDescription and one for existing geometry schemas that can be represented using RDF literals with as root datatype property omg:hasSimpleGeometryDescription. This first series of properties (e.g. fog:asGltf) is then splitted per version of the geometry schema (e.g. fog:asGltf_v2.0), which are again splitted further if the geometry format consists of different kind of files (e.g. fog:asGltf_v2.0-glb). The last taxonomy of properties extends the OMG datatype property omg:hasReferencedGeometryId and allows to define a geometry description as part of a larger geometry description, by mentioning the ID of the geometry object related to the geometry schema used. If a geometry schema contains multiple types of IDs, a distinction is made by defining more specific subproperties (e.g. fog:hasRevitId-element). The FOG ontology is incomplete by nature, as it is impossible to contain all existing geometry schemas.",

The ontology provides directional, axis-related properties (e.g., longitudinal axis: front, center, rear) and topological properties (e.g., meet, contained in, intersect). These properties are finally merged into combined properties (e.g., containedInFront) to reflect the spatial information of statements like 'A is in the front part of B'. The application context of the RELOC Ontology is the processing of existing damage documentation of bridges.",

SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture by including a lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) for its elementary classes and properties. With their different scope and different degrees of axiomatization, SSN and SOSA are able to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology engineering, and the Web of Things",

For more information on the group's activities see: http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/. The ontology was revised and modularized in 2015-2017 by the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Working Group, see: https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Semantic_Sensor_Network_Ontology. \n\nIn particular, (a) the scope is extended to include actuation and sampling; (b) the core concepts and properties are factored out into the SOSA ontology. The SSN ontology imports SOSA and adds formal axiomatization consistent with the text definitions in SOSA, and adds classes and properties to accommodate the scope of the original SSN ontology. ",

Knowledge about what entities and attributes to select is captured based on literature and investigating the pilot demonstration sites. An ontology can help to structure the surrounding data to support processes in different stages of the renovation. The final goal is to support planners in decision making process namely in site planning and pre-data collection phase, energy modelling, comfort analysis and so on to control cost and quality.",
