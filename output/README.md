# Output Folder

This folder keeps timestamped JSON backups generated by the GitHub Actions workflow for Excel-to-JSON conversion.

## File naming convention

Files are named using the pattern `<base_name>_<timestamp>.json`:


- `<base_name>`: the name of the Excel file (without its extension)  
- `<timestamp>`: UTC time in `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` format

For example:

```text
Ontologies_forRepo_20250601T093045Z.json
