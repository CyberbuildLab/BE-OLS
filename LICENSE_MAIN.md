BE-OLS follows a hybrid licensing model that separates code, metadata and curated datasets.
- Metadata extracted from ontologies is released under CC-4.0. 
- BE-OLS’s analysis contributions (e.g. harmonised categories, analyses, JSON/Excel datasets, and visualisations) are licensed under Appo.. 
- BE-OLS's platform code is released under the Apache-2.0 licence.
- Documentation is licensed under CC-BY-4.0. 
- The BE-OLS logo, name, and branding are not open licensed and remain protected.

Naturally, the referenced ontologies remain under their own licences.
