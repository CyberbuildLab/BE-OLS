The ontology allows the definition of different context frameworks, to create contexts within the frameworks, associate content to contexts, and to compare objects and values across contexts. At the implementation level, the content is stored in the named graphs of an RDF Dataset and the representation of context frameworks and contexts are managed in the default graph of the RDF Dataset. Since named graphs have identifiers, they can be associated with relevant metadata, such as provenance information or unit frameworks.","URI":"https:\/\/w3id.org\/digitalconstruction\/0.5\/Contexts#","Reference":"https:\/\/digitalconstruction.github.io\/Contexts\/v\/0.5\/","Linked-to ontologies AECO":null,"Linked-to ontologies UPPER":"schema, prov, skos","Linkage to\u00a0upper ontologies":"yes","Linkage to existing AECO ontologies":"no","Linkage to meta schema ontologies":"no","Conceptual Data model available":"yes","Accessible as Serialization":"yes","Accessible as a  URI":"yes","Clearly \u00a0documented":"yes","Use of annotations":"yes","Reused\/Extended":"yes","Assigned to":"Iryna","Alignment":1,"Accessability":3,"Quality":3,"PartOfCluster":"Yes","ClusterName":"Digital Construction","FOOPS":null},{"Name":"Digital Construction - Entities","Acronym":"dice","Version":0.5,"Year published":2020.0,"Domain (deprecated)":"Construction","Primary Domain":"Production (Process)","Secondary Domain":null,"FAIR - 5 star":null,"Level of maintenance":null,"Level of use":null,"Licensing":"CC BY 4.0","Used Standards":"ISO\/IEC 21838-2","Short Description":"Digital Construction Entities (DICE) ontology defines the basic terms useful to represent digitalized construction processes (utilizing BIM, IoT, mobile devices, ERP, and so on) and modern construction management methods and practices developed in the field of lean construction.

It explicitly defines the project intent and project status. While the project intent describes the project aim in the form of, e.g., the construction schedule and a 3D building design, the project status describes the situation on the construction site as it was actually observed. In this way, project intent and status can be directly compared to identify any deviations between the two. The project intent is further differentiated into as-planned when referring to processes and as-designed when referring to processes and their required resources. Their counterparts of the project status are as-performed and as-built. The ontology is centred around the construction processes (dtc:Process). These are defined on three levels of detail. The processes have various types of construction resources (dtc:Resource) that are required for their execution, dedicated areas where they are performed (dtc:WorkingZone), preconditions that restrict their starting time (dtc:Precondition), and building elements (bot:Element) that result from their completion. The ontology is designed to form the starting point for representing digital twins of the construction phase. It is by no means an exhaustive list of all concepts related to Digital Twin Construction.

These geometry descriptions can be (1) RDF-based (e.g. using specific ontologies such as GEOM, OntoBREP, etc.), (2) RDF literals containing embedded geometry of existing geometry formats and (3) RDF literals containing a reference to an external geometry file. The FOG ontology extends the Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) and consists of three taxonomies of properties. The first two are related to standalone geometry descriptions, i.e. one for RDF-based geometry schemas with as root object property the omg:hasComplexGeometryDescription and one for existing geometry schemas that can be represented using RDF literals with as root datatype property omg:hasSimpleGeometryDescription. This first series of properties (e.g. fog:asGltf) is then splitted per version of the geometry schema (e.g. fog:asGltf_v2.0), which are again splitted further if the geometry format consists of different kind of files (e.g. fog:asGltf_v2.0-glb). The last taxonomy of properties extends the OMG datatype property omg:hasReferencedGeometryId and allows to define a geometry description as part of a larger geometry description, by mentioning the ID of the geometry object related to the geometry schema used. If a geometry schema contains multiple types of IDs, a distinction is made by defining more specific subproperties (e.g. fog:hasRevitId-element). The FOG ontology is incomplete by nature, as it is impossible to contain all existing geometry schemas.","URI":"https:\/\/w3id.org\/fog#","Reference":"https:\/\/w3id.org\/fog#","Linked-to ontologies AECO":"omg","Linked-to ontologies UPPER":"terms, vann, foaf, voaf, dbr, cc","Linkage to\u00a0upper ontologies":"yes","Linkage to existing AECO ontologies":"no","Linkage to meta schema ontologies":"no","Conceptual Data model available":"yes","Accessible as Serialization":"yes","Accessible as a  URI":"yes","Clearly \u00a0documented":"yes","Use of annotations":"yes","Reused\/Extended":"yes","Assigned to":"Karim","Alignment":1,"Accessability":3,"Quality":3,"PartOfCluster":"No","ClusterName":null,"FOOPS":null},{"Name":"Asset Condition Integration from ICDD to AMS","Acronym":"icdd2ams","Version":null,"Year published":2021.0,"Domain (deprecated)":"Connector Ontology","Primary Domain":"BE Product (Infrastructure)","Secondary Domain":"Quality","FAIR - 5 star":null,"Level of maintenance":null,"Level of use":null,"Licensing":"CC BY 4.0 ","Used Standards":"ICDD","Short Description":"I don\u2019t know what exactly is this.
