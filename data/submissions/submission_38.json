  "Short Description": "The Relative Location Ontology (RELOC) enables the expression of the spatial relationship between two objects using directional-topological terms. The ontology is designed to be compatible with the natural language-based approach of describing relative locations, enabling the conversion of existing location descriptions into structured spatial graph representations. The ontology provides directional, axis-related properties (e.g., longitudinal axis: front, center, rear) and topological properties (e.g., meet, contained in, intersect). These properties are finally merged into combined properties (e.g., containedInFront) to reflect the spatial information of statements like A is in the front part of B. The application context of the RELOC Ontology is the processing of existing damage documentation of bridges.",
