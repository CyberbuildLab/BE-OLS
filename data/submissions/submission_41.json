  "Short Description": "The Construction Terminology (CTERM) ontology provides a multilingual and structured vocabulary for describing construction concepts and parameters. It defines classes such as cterm:Object, cterm:Material, cterm:Function, cterm:Aspect, and cterm:Finishing, used by CI and CR for consistent annotation. Parameter subclasses (cterm:DimensionParameter, cterm:PhysicalParameter, cterm:PerformanceParameter) model measurable or qualitative characteristics using QUDT units. CTERM supports multiple classification systems (DIN 276, UNI 8290, Uniclass, Omniclass, Uniformat, StLB) and includes multilingual labels (e.g., “Reinforcement”@en, “Bewehrung”@de, “Armatura”@it). It acts as the terminological backbone of the ontology network and can be exported as a SKOS vocabulary in future work.",
