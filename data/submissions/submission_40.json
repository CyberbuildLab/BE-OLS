  "Short Description": "The Construction Resources (CR) ontology defines the shared resource domain connecting cost, scheduling and geometrical data. The central class cr:Resource specializes into cr:LabourResource, cr:EquipmentResource, and cr:MaterialResource, aligned respectively with DTC classes for workers, equipment, and materials. It includes mechanisms for aggregation (cr:hasSubResource), and cross-domain assignments (cr:AssignmentSet, cr:Assignment) linking ci:CostItem, dtc:Task, and ifc:IfcProduct. Parameters such as quantity, utilization rate, and formulas enable accurate data exchange between domains. CR bridges CI and DTC, ensuring unified representation of resources for cost- and time-centric project management.",
