# Built Environment - Ontology Lookup Service (BE-OLS)

This is the repository of the **Built Environment - Ontology Lookup Service (BE-OLS)** that can be accessed at: [(https://cyberbuildlab.github.io/BE-OLS/)]

The BE-OLS is developed and maintained by a team of volunteers who are members of the [EC3 Modelling & Standards Committee](https://ec-3.org/governance/technical-committees/modelling-standards-committee/).


Key Features

📚 100+ Ontologies – A vast database covering various built environment topics.

🔍 Advanced Filters – Extensive search capabilities to refine ontology selection.

📊 Multi-Criteria Ontology Rating – Evaluation based on alignment, accessibility, robustness, quality, and quantity.

🏗️ Domain-Driven Categorisation – Classification into 20 built environment-specific domains.

✅ FAIR Assessment – Ensuring ontologies are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR principles).

🌐 Linked Built Environment Data Cloud – Mapping relationships between domain ontologies for better interoperability.
