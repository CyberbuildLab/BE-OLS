# Built Environment - Ontology Lookup Service (BE-OLS)

This is the repository of the **Built Environment - Ontology Lookup Service (BE-OLS)** that can be accessed at: [(https://cyberbuildlab.github.io/BE-OLS/)]

The BE-OLS is developed and maintained by a team of volunteers who are members of the [EC3 Modelling & Standards Committee](https://ec-3.org/governance/technical-committees/modelling-standards-committee/).


Key Features
==========

📚 100+ Ontologies – A vast database covering various built environment topics.

🔍 Advanced Filters – Extensive search capabilities to refine ontology selection.

📊 Multi-Criteria Ontology Rating – Evaluation based on alignment, accessibility, robustness, quality, and quantity.

🏗️ Domain-Driven Categorisation – Classification into 20 built environment-specific domains.

✅ FAIR Assessment – Ensuring ontologies are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR principles).

🌐 Linked Built Environment Data Cloud – Mapping relationships between domain ontologies for better interoperability.

Issues (including Missing Ontologies)
==========
If you notice some error in the information provided by the OLS or a missing ontology, please submit an *Issue*.

To suggest the addition of a missing ontology, please submit the following information:
* Name: {name of the ontology}
* Acronym: {the namespeace acronym, e.g. bot}
* URI/Namespace: {https://w3id.org/...}
* Reference: {weblink to a webpage or DOI of the paper}
* Link to AEC ontologies: {they should normally be already in BE-OLS. If not, please submit an Issue to add those too :)}
* Link to Upper ontologies: {ontologies like: schema, terms, prov, skos, vann, cc, foaf, qudt, unit, og, fno}
* Link to other professional domain ontologies: {ontologies that link to (sub)-domains that may not really be within AEC, e.g. eli}
